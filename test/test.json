Bob Doran is a computing veteran with a Silicon Valley stint as Principal Computer Architect at Amdahl Corporation from 1976 to 1982; he is an educator who taught The City University London and Massey University in New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, he was the Head of Department and Professor of Computer Science at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Like many people in the field, Bob has been fascinated by its history and in recent years his curiosity has shifted towards the deeply antipodean story of totalisators.",
